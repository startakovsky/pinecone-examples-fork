    "### What is Semantic Search and how will we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Semantic search_ is exactly the kind of search where the _meaning_ of the search query is the thing that's used, rather than it being done by keyword lookups. Pretrained neural networks on large sets of text data have been shown to be very effective at encoding the _meaning_ of a particular phrase, sentence, paragraph or long document into a data structure known as a [vector embedding](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are going to demonstrate Pinecone's semantic search capabilities with an off-the-shelf, pretrained NLP model. In the process we'll learn a few things."

Pinecone effeciently estimates which of the uploaded vector embeddings have the highest similarity when paired with the query term's embedding, and the database will scale to billions of embeddings maintaining low-latency and high throughput. In this example we have upserted over 700,000 embeddings. Our [starter plan](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) supports up to one million. "
