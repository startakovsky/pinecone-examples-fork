Pretrained neural networks on large sets of text data have been shown to be effective at encoding the _meaning_ of a particular phrase, sentence, paragraph or long document into a data structure known as a [vector embedding](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/).\n",

              "text              BOSTON (AP) — Dave Dombrowski wanted to make sure he and Alex Cora were on the same page, so the Red Sox boss sent off an email for his new manager's approval.\\nThe response: A thumbs-up emoji.\\nTony La Russa and Jim Leyland never did that.\\n\"He's a good emoji texter,\" Dombrowski said with a laugh this month as the team turned its thoughts toward spring training. \"He's very good with the thumbs-up. My children, they help me out at times.\"\\nA native of Puerto Rico, Cora is already a pioneer as the first minority manager in the history of a franchise that was the last to field a black player. But he's also a new kind of Red Sox dugout boss: One of the youngest managers in franchise history, giving him a unique chance to connect with his players.\\n\"He's not too far removed from actually playing the game. He's played — actually, personally — with some of my teammates now,\" Boston outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. said. \"I think it's going to be a great combination of old school and new school. He's learned from the past, and he's going to be able to put his own twist on things.\"\\nStill just 42 and in his first major league managerial job, Cora is no newbie.\\nHis shaved head shows the stubble of a receded hairline, with some gray around the temples picked up during a 14-year career spent with six big-league teams. As a member of the Red Sox from 2005-08, he was a part of the franchise's 2007 World Series title and was teammates with current second baseman Dustin Pedroia. (He also overlapped with first baseman Mitch Moreland for about five days with the Rangers in 2010.)\\nIt's this that made him an intriguing choice to replace John Farrell, who was fired last fall at the age of 55 despite leading Boston to the first back-to-back AL East titles in franchise history. Farrell's predecessor, Bobby Valentine, was 62 for his lone season in Boston; you'd have to go back to Kevin Kennedy, who was 41 when he was hired in 1995, to find a younger Red Sox skipper.\\n\"I'm 42. I'm young...\n",

              "      <td>BOSTON (AP) — Dave Dombrowski wanted to make sure he and Alex Cora were on the same page, so the Red Sox boss sent off an email for his new manager's approval.\\nThe response: A thumbs-up emoji.\\nTony La Russa and Jim Leyland never did that.\\n\"He's a good emoji texter,\" Dombrowski said with a laugh this month as the team turned its thoughts toward spring training. \"He's very good with the thumbs-up. My children, they help me out at times.\"\\nA native of Puerto Rico, Cora is already a pioneer as the first minority manager in the history of a franchise that was the last to field a black player. But he's also a new kind of Red Sox dugout boss: One of the youngest managers in franchise history, giving him a unique chance to connect with his players.\\n\"He's not too far removed from actually playing the game. He's played — actually, personally — with some of my teammates now,\" Boston outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. said. \"I think it's going to be a great combination of old school and new school. He's learned from the past, and he's going to be able to put his own twist on things.\"\\nStill just 42 and in his first major league managerial job, Cora is no newbie.\\nHis shaved head shows the stubble of a receded hairline, with some gray around the temples picked up during a 14-year career spent with six big-league teams. As a member of the Red Sox from 2005-08, he was a part of the franchise's 2007 World Series title and was teammates with current second baseman Dustin Pedroia. (He also overlapped with first baseman Mitch Moreland for about five days with the Rangers in 2010.)\\nIt's this that made him an intriguing choice to replace John Farrell, who was fired last fall at the age of 55 despite leading Boston to the first back-to-back AL East titles in franchise history. Farrell's predecessor, Bobby Valentine, was 62 for his lone season in Boston; you'd have to go back to Kevin Kennedy, who was 41 when he was hired in 1995, to find a younger Red Sox skipper.\\n\"I'm 42.

Environment Commissioner Karmenu Vella said Tuesday that \"we cannot go on postponing and delaying,\" noting that some countries are still failing to meet deadlines set for 2005 and 2010. His warning came after talks with representatives from Britain, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. Vella said some had proposed new measures to meet EU air quality standards governing particles levels from sources like vehicle exhausts or industry, but that at first view the measures appear insufficient.

His warning came after talks with representatives from Britain, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. Vella said some had proposed new measures to meet EU air quality standards governing particles levels from sources like vehicle exhausts or industry, but that at first view the measures appear insufficient.

Authorities say they might have to turn off most city taps in mid-April if residents don't save enough water, a scenario that has raised concerns about security. The city says police and the military would help secure water collection sites if the tap closure occurs. The city says it is taking over management of the Newlands neighborhood site because noise and traffic congestion by people collecting water around the clock is disturbing neighbors and an adjacent home for the elderly.

The leaked assessment published Monday by news website BuzzFeed says if Britain reaches a free trade deal with the EU, growth will be 5 percent lower than current forecasts over 15 years. The document, dated this month, says if there is no deal and Britain resorts to World Trade Organization terms, growth will fall 8 percent.
