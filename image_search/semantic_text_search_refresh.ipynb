    "### What is Semantic Search and how will we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Semantic search_ is search where the _meaning_ of the search query is the focus, rather than using keyword lookups. Pretrained neural networks on large sets of text data have been shown to be effective at encoding the _meaning_ of a particular phrase, sentence, paragraph or long document into a data structure known as a [vector embedding](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/).\n",

    "In this example, we are going to demonstrate Pinecone's semantic search capabilities with an off-the-shelf, pretrained NLP model. In the process we'll learn a few things."

       "As more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the global ocean soaks up much of the excess, storing roughly 30 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions coming from human activities. In this sense, the ocean has acted as a buffer to slow down the greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere and, thus, global warming. However, this process also increases the acidity of seawater and can affect the health of marine organisms and the ocean ecosystem. New research by University of Delaware oceanographer Wei-Jun Cai and colleagues at Université Libre de Bruxelles, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, University of Hawaii at Manoa and ETH Zurich, now reveals that the water over the continental shelves is shouldering a larger portion of the load, taking up more and more of this atmospheric carbon dioxide.

       "Emergency services were put on standby Saturday in Majuro, as rising king tides threatened to flood the capital of the low-lying Marshall Islands. The national weather service warned \"major inundation\" was possible from Saturday evening through to Tuesday at peak tide periods in the Pacific island nation, highlighting its vulnerability to rising sea levels. \"We're on stand-by through Tuesday,\" Public Works Minister Tony Muller said Saturday as the 30,000 population of Majuro Atoll braced for the expected floods. Heavy equipment, including bulldozers, was being positioned at critical locations around Majuro so emergency crews can respond quickly in the event of flooding, he said. Majuro is barely a metre above sea level and the single road along the 30-mile (50-kilometre) length of the coral atoll is often blocked during serious flooding by coral, rocks, sand and garbage tossed up by waves.</td>\n",
